            While my academic background is rooted in business administration,
            I have actively pursued opportunities to expand my technical knowledge
            and skills in frontend web development. I have immersed myself in
            learning MERN stack web development through solid online courses and
            personal projects. Through this process, I have developed a strong
            foundation in JavaScript, React.js, Express.js, Node.js, Mongo DB, HTML,
            CSS and other relevant skills. Aside from my technical skills, I also
            flourished myself with co-curricular experiences which make me a
            competent candidate for the job in your organization. The experience I
            have acquired being a sub-executive of NSU Ethics Club from March 2016
            to May 2017 shaped my leadership and management skill. Due to my
            academic background, I have a strategic mindset and a strong
            understanding of the importance of aligning technology with business
            objectives. I can effectively translate business requirements into
            technical solutions and create web applications that drive user
            engagement and support organizational goals.

            In addition to my technical skills, I possess excellent analytical
            abilities, attention to detail, and a commitment to delivering high-quality
            work within project deadlines. I am a fast learner and continuously seek
            opportunities to stay updated with emerging technologies and industry
            trends.
